# μPsyc

μPsyc is a music generation system utilizing a genetic algorithm with a fitness function using rules from music-psychology.

## Publications
This system and various experiments and online surveys pertaining to it was presented at the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation in Wellington, New Zealand, 2019: <br>
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8790099

This work was also the subject of my master's thesis.

## Use
A standalone version is available here: http://www.braebie.com/downloads/μPsyc.zip <br>
Just run the executable to use. It will make and write information (CSVs and MIDIs) to a folder named output. Different settings can be edited in the settings.cfg file to change how to algorithm runs. Note that the parsing is very sensitive (doesn't trim spaces, etc.) Sorry!

Alternatively, compile the code here using visual studio (start Music.sln).

## Example Musical Output
Output from the algorithm can be listened to here: http://braebie.com/research.html
